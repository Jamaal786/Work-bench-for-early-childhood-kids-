# Work bench for eary childhood kids

## 📌 Overview
This was my year 13 project for the course product design. I worked with a main client and stakeholders who gave me a problem and certain requirements that they needed for the product to have. For this project, the children had carpentry tools that did not have a proper storage space. The chldren also did not have a proper area to use the tools. My client and stakeholder wanted a custom built product to store the carpentry tools and an area for them to work.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Must be safe for children i.e. stable, proper finishing, sanded
- Hold carpentry items
- A big enough area for the children to play around with the toys

## 🛠 Tools & Concepts Used
- Inventor
- Carpentry tools and knowledge

## 🔍 Methodology
The first thing I needed to do was find out the requirements that both my client and stakeholders needed for this carpentry item. The requirements included : <br>
- must be safe
- must hold carpentry items such as hammers, saws, helmets, screwdrivers, saws, shoes
- A table for the kids to use for their work
- Strong, hardy and stable
- Internal storage to put away all the items when closing up, preferrably with a lock and key
- Rounded edges around table top
<br>
After recieving the requirements, I did some research on existing carpentry storage and types of work benches available for children. After researching different types of work benches and storage available, I implemented concepts and themes into designs, which I showed to my client and stakeholder. After consideration, they decided on a final design which they wanted. After the final design was chosen, I created a specifications list for me to follow during construction, and made some 3D modelling of the design. Using the 3D modelling, I could create a parts list for cutting.

### Frame and panel
The frame was made up of treated timbre wood. I created a parts list to send off to my teacher, who used a mitre saw to obtain the correct angle. The frame followed the table shape of a hexagon to ensure multiple children could work at the table at the same time. With the hexagon shape, more tools could be hung on the panels compared to just one rectangular work bench. The frame was attached to each other via glue and screws. This was particulary difficult due to the wood warping. So I needed help from clamps and the teachers experience. <br>

After the frame was completed, I had to attach the panels. This was tricky due to the angle the MDF had to be cut. However, with clamps, glue and screws, it was attached onto the frame. There was still some warping and bad fitment in some areas. It needed sanding and adjustments to make it a snug fit.

### Table top, support, and lid

The table was made up of MDF as well and had a hexagonal shape. I used a circular saw to cut the table into shape. I had a make-shift jig to ensure I cut in a straight line. After cutting the table, I used a router to round off the edges and sanded the top surface to ensure a smooth and clean finish. The support was a simple square MDF which was then attached to each other though screws and wood glue. However, a problem did arise when I placed the frame ontop of the table top. The frame was too big and there was not enough space for the kids to work on the table top. To tackle this, I shifted the frame to the edge, and adjusted the support on the bottom to ensure stability. This made sure that there was 3 working edsges for the children to use easily, and only one panel could not be accessed. However, that panel could be flushed against the wall. The client and stakeholders agreed with the change of the design. The lid for covering the storage unit was also a simple hexagonal shape from leftoever material. I attached handles to the top and added a lock to the edge so it could be locked and nothing could be stolen. 


## 📊 Results
- The table worked perfectly even with the change at the end.
- Housed all required equiment
- Lock worked well and ensured security
- Size and proportion of the table was apprpriate
- Client and stakeholders were happy with final product
